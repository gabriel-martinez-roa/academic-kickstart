# Course Description

This introductory course was taught by professor [Ricardo Serrano-Padial](https://www.serrano-padial.com) during his time in UW-Madison. The TA material found here was put together by several TA's. The formatting is mine. Students learned the core concepts in economics starting from demand and supply and exploring deeper into producer and consumer theory. Students learned both about competitive, well-functioning markets as well as settings where markets fail or are characterized by  market power.

# Course Description

This course was taught by professor [Ananth Seshadri](https://econ.wisc.edu/staff/seshadri-ananth/). The intended audience is undergraduate economics majors, usually in their last years of college. The TA material found here was put together by several TA's. The formatting is mine. Students learned analytical tools to study macroeconomic questions through the eyes of the Neoclassical growth theory.

* **Textbook:** Macroeconomics, by Robert J. Barro (5th Edition).

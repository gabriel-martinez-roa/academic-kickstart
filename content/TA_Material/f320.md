# Course Description

This course is taught by professor [Bulent Paker](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/bulent-paker).
The goal of this course is for students to learn the basic theoretical foundations and the practical skills that an investment professional needs.

In this website page you can find an **unofficial** outline of the lectures.
I am putting together this pdf to aid you in studying for this class by making sure you have a clear idea of what topics were covered in each lecture as well as what chapters in the book are connected with the topics discussed. I've also summarized some of the main intuitions for the main formulas that were presented in class.

Similarly, I will be posting bi-weekly practice problems that will help you to asses your understanding of the material, and prepare for the exam.

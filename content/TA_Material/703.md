# Course Description

This course was taught by professor [Raymond Deneckere](https://econ.wisc.edu/staff/deneckere-raymond/). The first half of the course was taught during the summer and the second  half during  the  fall semester. The intended audience is first-year Ph.D. students in the economics department.

In this proof-based course, students develop the tools to understand and formulate rigorous mathematical proofs. They learn tools in real analysis to prove classic theorems like Weierstrass, the implicit function theorem and optimization theorems (Lagrange and Kuhn Tucker).

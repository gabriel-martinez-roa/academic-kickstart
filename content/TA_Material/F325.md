# Course Description

This course is taught by professor [Bulent Paker](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/bulent-paker).
The aim of this course is to teach you the basic theoretical foundations as well as the practical issues and skills necessary for the corporate finance professional.

In this website page you can find an **unofficial** outline of the lectures. I am putting together this pdf to aid you in studying for this class by making sure you have a clear idea of what topics were covered in class and what chapters in the book are connected with the topics discussed. I've also summarized some of the main intuitions for the main formulas that were presented in class.

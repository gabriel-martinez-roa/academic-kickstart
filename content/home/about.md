# Biography

Hi, my name is Gabriel. I am an economist trained at the [University of Wisconsin](https://econ.wisc.edu/doctoral/job-market-candidates/). My research interests center on two topics. In the first one I study the design of persuasive information when the audience is uncertain about how informative a message is. The second topic studies economic interactions that occur in networks. These interactions include both markets with imperfect competition and non-cooperative games among groups of players.

abstract = "In digital platforms, agents have vast access to information, but the quality of it is usually unclear to them. I study this phenomenon as a Bayesian persuasion game with multiple senders that have partial control over the beliefs of a receiver. The receiver knows the signal chosen by all senders but randomly observes the realization of only one such signal. Senders can pool their signals, so the receiver is uncertain about the informativeness of the message received. This uncertainty may incentivize a sender to provide more or less information compared to the benchmark without uncertainty. The central insight is that each sender's optimal signal is chosen to affect the average signal conditional on the actions of other senders. I apply this framework in some important examples to derive policy recommendations for information platforms like social media."

#"People regularly receive recommendations regarding how to behave based on some piece of evidence. Whether it is a news report, an article in a magazine or social media, a marketing campaign, a policy evaluation, etc, they usually have data or experiments that support their statements. However, for many decision makers, it is often hard or impossible to fully understand the details of how the study was designed, the power of its tests, or its external validity. In a model of bayesian persuasion, I consider a receiver with uncertainty about the signal that a sender uses to persuade. Both exogenous and endogenous uncertainty can be accommodated. I show how this asymmetry in the understanding of the signal may benefit some types of senders and harm others. As in a lemons market, asymmetric persuasion is in general good for low types, bad for high types and can lead to no information transmitted in equilibrium. Finally, I show that uncertainty imposes endogenous constraints on the posteriors that an information designer can implement."

#abstract_short = "I extend the classic model of Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011) to allow for uncertainty about the source of information. There are multiple senders that can differ in their objectives, or in their information, and the receiver has uncertainty about the source of the message received. I show that whenever biased information is inevitable, news platforms have incentives to exert editorial power and limit, though not eliminate, the frequency of opinions that try to confuse the audience. Similarly, presenting a receiver with opposed views without requiring to disclose their bias, is less informative than having a source with a known biased perspective."

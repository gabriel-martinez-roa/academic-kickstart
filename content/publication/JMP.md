abstract = "People regularly receive recommendations regarding how to behave based on some piece of evidence. Whether it is a news report, an article in a magazine or social media, a marketing campaign, a policy evaluation, etc, they usually have data or experiments that support their statements. However, for many decision makers, it is often hard or impossible to fully understand the details of how the study was designed, the power of its tests, or its external validity. In a model of bayesian persuasion, I consider a receiver with uncertainty about the signal that a sender uses to persuade. Both exogenous and endogenous uncertainty can be accommodated. I show how this asymmetry in the understanding of the signal may benefit some types of senders and harm others. As in a lemons market, asymmetric persuasion is in general good for low types, bad for high types and can lead to no information transmitted in equilibrium. Finally, I show that uncertainty imposes endogenous constraints on the posteriors that an information designer can implement."

abstract_short = "I extend the bayesian persuasion model to allow for types of senders. These can differ in their objectives, in their information or be noise types. I characterize equilibrium and find that this asymmetric information creates a lemmons-market interaction between the sender and the receiver."

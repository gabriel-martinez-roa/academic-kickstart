# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "we study the dynamic behavior of decentralized markets. Using a flexible framework we consider the standard double auction linear pricing model to define market clearing exchanges that are interconnected via the assets they trade and the players that participate in them. This is, we consider market interactions in a hyper-graph, which allows for multilateral interactions and arbitrary connections between exchanges. We are interested in the efficiency properties of decentralized structures with frequent trading. Likewise, we explore open questions about the network effects of financial inclusion, innovation and over-the-counter trading of standardized assets."

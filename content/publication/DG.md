abstract = "This paper examines games among groups of players who act non-cooperatively. Players can be members of multiple groups (contracts), and their payoffs exhibit externalities both within and across groups. We characterize equilibrium for games in which the payoff externalities among groups are symmetric for each player. We characterize when bilateral vs. multilateral contracts maximize total welfare. Furthermore, we show that creating private clubs, in which a subset of group members signs a separate contract, can improve welfare by reducing negative strategic externalities in the larger contract."
